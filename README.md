# DATA_CLEANING_PROJECT_SQL




Excited to share my first SQL project on global company layoffs!

Took me a little while but I remained consistent and completed a comprehensive data cleaning project from Alex Freberg Data Analyst Bootcamp on a real dataset detailing layoffs across various industries and countries worldwide. This project allowed me to learn SQL at an advanced level and provided invaluable insights into the data-cleaning process.

üîç Project Overview:
In this project, I tackled a real-world dataset that captured layoff events from companies around the globe. The primary goal was to transform raw, messy data into a clean and structured format suitable for trend analysis and visualization.

üîß Key Steps and Techniques:

Data Collection: 
Acquired a real-world dataset of global layoffs, which included multiple data sources with various formats and structures.

Data Cleaning: 
Performed extensive cleaning operations, including:
Removing duplicate entries to ensure accuracy of the data through CTE and Window functions.

Standardizing Formats: 
Standardized date formats, company and industry names for consistency using Trim function.

Correcting Inconsistencies: 
Addressed data entry errors and ensured uniformity across the dataset.

Data Transformation: 
Used SQL to transform the data into a structured format, creating new tables and relationships for enhanced data integrity.

Validation: 
Conducted thorough checks to validate the cleaned data, ensuring accuracy and reliability for downstream analysis.

üìä Outcome and Insights:

The cleaned dataset is now a robust foundation for advanced analysis, enabling the extraction of meaningful insights and trends in global layoffs. 
The next project includes the exploration of this cleaned data.

Thanks alot Alex Freberg Sir for everything...!!!
